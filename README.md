This is the GitHub repository for the following paper:

Free CM, Mangin T, GarcÃ­a Molinos J, Ojea E, Costello C, Gaines SD (2020) Realistic fisheries management reforms could mitigate the impacts of climate change in most countries. In press at PLoS One.

The data are located in two places:
1. Realistic adaptation scenarios: imperfect > data
2. Gaines et al. adaptation scenarios: data > gaines

The code for building these datasets are also spread between two locations:
1. Realistic adaptation scenarios: imperfect > data (Step 2s)
2. Gaines et al. adaptation scenarios: code (Steps 1 through 3)

The figures for the paper are built in: code > paper_figures
